## Habit Tracker

This is a simple habit tracker using [Pixela](https://pixe.la/).

Pixela is a tracking site which can only be used via the API. There's no option for updating it on the website itself.

This habit tracker records the number of hours coded, permits you to change the number of hours coded on a given day, or to delete the entry altogether.

You can [access the tracker on Replit](https://replit.com/@zan-clifton/habit-tracker?v=1).
